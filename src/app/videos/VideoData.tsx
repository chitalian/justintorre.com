          had the extremely thoughtful idea of setting up a car Parade to
          celebrate our heros. And I had the privilege to be a part of filming
          it. Eric did the editing.

          Spring semester 2017, I was the TA (Teaching Assistant) for Dr.
          Schulte at Northeastern University. The class she teaches is a
          condensed introductory to engineering class, which is effectively a
          single 8 credit class. Within this class the students are challenged
          to learn the engineering design process. This is done by a series of
          assignments teaching AutoCAD, C++, Matlab, Arduino, and Solidworks.
          The idea behind the class is to use all of these skills to produce a
          final project that is intended as a museum exhibit for 3rd-5th
          graders. For the first time these final projects were brought to a
          local elementary school, Beachmont veterans memorial school.

          The Water Wall project was an extremely fun project that helped spark
          my interest in engineering. For this project we configured an array of
          solenoid water valves that could be controlled via a micro controller.
          This project was so much fun that I am currently building a much
          larger one, and with an added 4 years of college experience I hope
          this new Water Wall is going to be amazing.
